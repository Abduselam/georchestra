extractor app and geoserver both use different versions of this plugin because of dependencies.  extractorapp uses Geotools 2.6.2 but GeoServer uses 2.5-SNAPSHOT.  So this plugin must be build with the correct parameters.

mvn install -Dgt.version=2.6.2



The cockpit script builds them correctly when deploying extractorapp and GeoServer
