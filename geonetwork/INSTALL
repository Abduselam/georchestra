Configuration information is in patches/src/<server_id>/ primarily maven.filter

Before a build one must create a directory in patches/src/ to contain the configuration for the target server. Next one must create the configuration files.  See existing examples.

Next you can build.  The recommended method is to use cockpit/trunk/deploy.sh

cd cockpit/trunk/
./deploy.sh <server_id> geonetwork

the alternative is the following (execute in geonetwork/trunk)

mvn clean install -Dserver=<server_id>
scp target/geonetwork-private.war <desination server>
