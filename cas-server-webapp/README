This is a CAS webapp.  When it is run it connects to the embedded-ldap project.
(Which must be ran previously)  

It assumes that the user DN are uid=%u,ou=users,ou=system.  To change this the
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/deployerConfigContext.xml file must be updated

"mvn install" must be run prior to running "mvn jetty:run", this is because the
CAS webapp doesn't have any java files, so the "target" directory isn't created
when running "mvn jetty:run".

jetty is started on port 9090.
