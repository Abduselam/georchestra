# Contributing

First of all: thanks for contributing!

## Code conventions

* Javascript: two space indents. No tabs.

## Commits policy

* commits must be atomic: just one consistent change per commit
* when possible, refer to an issue on the commit message, for example adding
  `(cf #xx)` at the end of the commit message, or `fix ##` to close the issue.
* never commit environnement related changes

## Submitting a pull request

* keep pull request as simple as possible
